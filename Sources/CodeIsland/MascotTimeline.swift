/// per-frame Canvas redraws when the panel is hidden/occluded or the machine
/// is asleep, and re-anchor their schedules on wake instead of replaying every
/// missed tick in a catch-up burst.

/// `content` receives the mascot-local time `t` (already scaled by the user's
/// animation-speed setting), exactly like the raw pattern it replaces:
///
///     MascotTimeline(interval: 0.05) { t in workCanvas(t: t) }
///
/// The effective interval is clamped to `minInterval` (20 fps): a menu-bar-
/// sized pixel sprite gains nothing perceivable above that, and the wasted
/// wakeups were a real contributor to "NotchDeck makes my Mac warm" (#14).
